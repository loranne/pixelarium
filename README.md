# Pixelarium - an image repo experiment

In progress

## Upload image

 - Using Cloudinary API

### Things to investigate

What metadata is going to come through about each image? Will I be able to grab EXIF stuff? Device details would be neat.

## Search features

- OpenCV perhaps (would allow search by hexcode)
- Tag search
- Date search
- Title search

### Concerns

- Fuzzy matching of text-based searches
- Can we do color families for hexcodes?
